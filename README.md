# Horiseon Social Solution Services Code Refactor
This project is a website for Horiseon Social Solution Services, a company that provides various online marketing solutions. The website showcases the services provided by the company and their benefits. I have been tasked with refactoring the starter code to make them more semantic and accessible.  

The project includes HTML and CSS files that were used to create the website.

# Getting Started
To view the website, open the index.html file in a web browser.

To view and edit the CSS styles, open the style.css file in a code editor.
